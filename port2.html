                                Qualitative or categorical data consists of variables that cannot be 
                                quantified numerically. Instead, these variables need to be classified 
                                into categories without any notion of size or magnitude. They can be 
                                represented in various forms, including auditory, visual, symbolic, 
                                perceptual, or textual.

                        <li><p>Information is created by processing and interpreting 
                            data to give it context and significance. It turns raw 
                            data into a meaningful format that aids in decision-making 
                            and problem-solving. Essentially, information is data that 
                            has been organized and presented in a way that adds value 
                            and relevance (In & Lee, 2017).
                        </p></li>

                            Information refers to the process of gathering, combining, 
                            analyzing, and presenting data to create understanding. 
                            While this definition outlines how information is derived 
                            from data, it doesn't fully explain what information actually is. 
                            Information is essentially data placed in context. It is data 
                            that have been processed to clarify their meaning. Once data 
                            are collected and contextualized, they become information. 
                            Therefore, while all information is derived from data, not 
                            all data qualify as information (Dammann, 2019) .

                        <h3>Components of Information System</h3>
                        <p>Information systems are comprised of five components: hardware, 
                            software, data, people, and processes. Although hardware, software, 
                            and data are often the primary focus when defining information systems, 
                            it is the inclusion of people and processes that differentiates this 
                            field from more technical disciplines like computer science. To fully 
                            understand information systems, it is important to comprehend how all 
                            these components work together to provide value to an organization (Bourgeois, 2020).
                        </p>
            
                        <p><strong>Technology</strong></p>
                        <p>Technology can be understood as the use of scientific knowledge for 
                            practical applications. From the creation of the wheel to the use 
                            of electricity for lighting, technology plays a significant role in 
                            our lives, often going unappreciated. The first three components of 
                            information systems: hardware, software, and data are all considered part 
                            of this technological domain.
                        </p>
            
                        <p><strong>Hardware</strong></p>
                        <p>Information systems hardware refers to the tangible, physical components 
                            of the technology that you can touch. Examples of hardware include 
                            computers, keyboards, disk drives, iPads, and flash drives.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>Software</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            Software consists of instructions that control hardware. It is intangible 
                            and comes in two main types: operating-system software, which enables 
                            hardware to function, and application software, which performs specific 
                            tasks. Examples include Microsoft Windows and Android for operating systems, 
                            and Microsoft Excel and Angry Birds for applications.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>Data</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            The third component is data, which consists of facts like your address and 
                            phone number. Although data itself is intangible and not very useful alone, 
                            when organized in a database, it becomes a valuable tool for businesses. 
                            Organizations use data to make and analyze decisions, which helps improve their operations.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>Network Communication</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            In addition to hardware, software, and data, communication is now recognized
                            as a vital component of information systems. Early personal computers 
                            were stand-alone and lacked network connectivity, but today’s systems 
                            are almost always connected to other devices or networks. While networking 
                            involves both hardware and software, its central role in modern 
                            systems has led to its classification as a distinct category.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>Process</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            The final component is process, which includes steps to achieve goals. 
                            Integrating information systems with organizational processes improves 
                            productivity and control. Effective use involves enhancing processes 
                            internally and with external partners, using concepts like "business 
                            process reengineering" and "enterprise resource planning" to gain a competitive advantage.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>People</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            In information systems, it's crucial to consider not just the technology 
                            but also the people involved. From help-desk staff and systems 
                            analysts to programmers and the chief information officer (CIO), these 
                            individuals play an essential role in integrating and managing information 
                            systems within an organization.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Types of Information Systems</h2>
                        <p>Information systems began to emerge in the 1960s, initially focusing on programming rather than user needs and lacking formal methodologies. This led to the creation of structured methodologies in the 1970s to address these issues (Al-Mamary et al., 2014).</p>
            
                        <h3>Transaction Processing System (TPS)</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>• TPS are foundational systems that manage and process data generated by daily business transactions.</p></li>
                            <li><p>• Designed to handle large volumes of routine, repetitive tasks efficiently and accurately, ensuring smooth business operations.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>• Key Characteristics:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>· Process transactions in real time, allowing immediate database updates.</p></li>
                            <li><p>· Essential in environments like retail and banking where timely information is crucial.</p></li>
                            <li><p>· High reliability and accuracy are required to prevent operational disruptions, financial discrepancies, and customer dissatisfaction.</p></li>
                            <li><p>· Maintain detailed records of transactions, which can be used for reporting, auditing, and analysis.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>• Examples:</strong></p>

                        <h3>Management Information Systems (MIS)</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>• MIS help middle management by providing the information necessary for decision-making and strategic planning.</p></li>
                            <li><p>• They process data from various sources (e.g., TPS) to create regular reports that summarize operational performance.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                
                        <p><strong>• Key Characteristics:</strong></p>
