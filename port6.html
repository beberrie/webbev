                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>The evolution of computers has significantly transformed industries, society, 
                        and personal life, progressing from large, specialized machines to compact and 
                        powerful systems. This development, driven by technological advancements and 
                        shifting societal needs, reflects the continuous efforts of engineers and innovators 
                        who have shaped the computer landscape over decades (Mahoney, 2005). Computing systems 
                        have advanced from mechanical devices to supercomputers and personal devices, expanding their 
                        roles in fields like business, science, and communication. Supercomputers evolved from proprietary 
                        systems to those using parallel and vector processing for research (Probert, 2022), while mainframes, 
                        initially central to financial data processing, became pivotal for business and government use. Personal 
                        computers decentralized computing in the 1980s, broadening accessibility and applications (Norris & Kraemer, 1996).
                         Minicomputers offered medium-scale solutions but were eventually overshadowed by microcomputers (Kusak, 1978). Servers advanced with 
                         virtualization technologies, enhancing scalability (Guynes & Windsor, 2011), and workstations transitioned from individual 
                         technical tasks to enterprise-level systems in networked environments (Bresnahan et al., 1996). These advancements highlight how different
                          computer types have shaped modern industries, with the transition from centralized systems to personal computing 
                          broadening technology's impact. Computing continues to drive progress in areas like AI and cloud computing, 
                          remaining central to technological development.

                        Different types of computers are designed with specific features tailored to their intended tasks. 
                        Gaming computers prioritize high processing power and advanced graphics capabilities, using fast 
                        processors, multiple cores, and powerful GPUs to handle demanding applications. They are equipped with 
                        fast memory and large storage capacities for optimal performance in rendering and calculations. Basic 
                        office computers, in contrast, focus on energy efficiency and modest processing power for everyday tasks 
                        like web browsing and word processing. Servers are designed to manage large amounts of data and support multiple 
                        users simultaneously, using powerful multi-core processors, extensive memory, and high storage to run complex 
                        applications, host websites, and manage databases. Supercomputers require immense energy to achieve the processing power 
                        needed for advanced research tasks such as climate modeling and physics simulations, operating at petaflop levels 
                        while consuming megawatts of power. Personal computers, on the other hand, are energy-efficient and suitable for general 
                        use, while servers employ virtualization technologies to optimize efficiency and scalability, reducing overall energy 
                        consumption. Each type of computer, from supercomputers to microcomputers, balances computational power, efficiency, 
                        and energy consumption to meet the demands of specific applications (Shaw, 1996).

                                    profitability. It consists of centralized computers housed in secure 
                                    rooms, with users accessing them through low-cost terminals. 
                                    While mainframes offer significant advantages, they also have 
                                    limitations, such as reliance on character-based applications and 
                                    the risk of single points of failure (Greeff & Ghoshal, 2004).
