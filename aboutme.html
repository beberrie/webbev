            Hello! I'm a passionate web developer and tech enthusiast. I enjoy creating user-friendly websites and exploring new technologies. I believe in the power of simplicity in design and the importance of functionality. My journey in the tech world started as a curiosity about how websites worked, and it has since grown into a full-fledged passion for development and innovation.

          <p>
            I'm a professional bedrotter who loves doomscrolling. I'm kind of not so good intellectually and unconscious, but I love learning.
            I kinda like it when people criticize me so I can be aware of the aspects I have to work on to.
            I love observing people and drown in my own thoughts. I love seeing people doing basic things in life.
            I love the film "Before Sunrise", 1995, I like its idea that life and relationships are shaped by choices rather than preordained paths.
            It speaks to the spontaneity and unpredictability of human connections. I love how it suggests that life is shaped by the decisions we make in the moment, rather than by some grand decision.
          </p>
          <p>My favorite line from Celine is, 
            "You know, I think you have to take life seriously, but you can’t take yourself too seriously. You have to accept that things are crazy and not everything makes sense."</p>
